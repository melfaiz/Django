Word embeddings generated by neural network
methods such as word2vec (W2V) are well known
to exhibit seemingly linear behaviour, e.g. the
embeddings of analogy “woman is to queen as
man is to king” approximately describe a parallelogram. This property is particularly intriguing
since the embeddings are not trained to achieve
it.

<h1>Math with words</h1>
<p>
    An analogy question is a question that asks you to find the relationship between words. For instance, the answer to the question: man is to woman, what king is to ____ is “queen” since you have to use the relationship in the first part of the question to fill in the blank.

    Interestingly, such embeddings exhibit seemingly linear behaviour 
    e.g. the respective embeddings of analogies, or word relationships of the form <mark>wa is to wa∗ as wb is to wb∗</mark>, often
    satisfy <mark>wa∗ − wa + wb ≈ wb∗</mark> , where w is the embedding of the word. <br>
</p>

    This enables analogical questions such as “man
    is to king as woman is to ..?” to be solved by vector addition and subtraction. Such high order structure is surprising
    since word embeddings are trained using only pairwise word
    co-occurrence data extracted from a text corpus.

<h1>Visualizing the analogy using t-SNE</h1>


<img src="{% static 'tf_tuto.png' %}" style="width: 100%;" class="img-fluid"> </img>
<p>To visualize the vectors, we are first going to be using a method known as t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding, also known as t-SNE. t-SNE will allow us to reduce the, in this case, 100 dimensions of the data, down to 2 dimensions. After we do that, it’s as simple as using a matplotlib scatter plot to plot it.
